amazon\_load is a simple jupyter notebook that takes in .json.gz data files, creates dataframes, does some cleaning, and saves csvs. The dataframe used for plotting does not have all the available data. final\_df has everything but isn't grouped by distinct products as the grouping process eradicates the categorical variables.
