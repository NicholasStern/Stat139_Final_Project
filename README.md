# Amazon Product Rating & Review Statistics

This is the code base for a final project completed for Harvard's Linear Models course,
STAT 139. The project team consisted of Nicholas Stern, Phoebe Wong, Yiming Xu, and Zizheng Xu.
The goal of the project was to carry out a fleet of statistical tests to explore the mechanisms
that drive Amazon product ratings.

San Diego. A publicly available sample of the datasets can be found <a href=http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/>here</a>.

May 1996 to July 2014.
